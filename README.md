# Pharma-dApp

A simple decentralized application created to track all the drugs prescribed by a doctor within a state. The smart contract is written in Solidity, which is primarily used in Ethereum blockchain. The frontend is made using HTML/CSS/JS.

### Things required to run

Since deploying a dapp on real Ethereum blockchain costs money, this app runs in a test network called Ganache. Ganche provides 10 free Ethereum accounts with 100 Ether on each. Ether is used in every transaction.  

* [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart) - A personal blochchain for Ethereum development.
* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) - To write Solidity smart contracts directly from the browser.
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) - MetaMask browser extension helps run Ethereum dApp in the browser without running a full Ethereum node. 
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) - To develop the frontend.
